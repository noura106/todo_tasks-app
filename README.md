# Test Flutter Project

This is a test Flutter project that I have created to demonstrate my Flutter development skills.

## Features

The project includes the following features:

1. **Task Management**: Users can create, view, edit, and delete tasks. Each task has a title, note, due date, start and end time, reminder, repeat, and color.
2. **Task Completion**: Users can mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
3. **Task Sorting**: Users can sort tasks based on due date, completion status, and title.
4. **Task Notifications**: Users can set reminders for tasks, and the app will display local notifications to remind them of upcoming tasks.
5. **Task Repeat**: Users can set tasks to repeat daily, weekly, or monthly.
6. **Task Sharing**: Users can share task details with others via email, messaging apps, or social media.

## Technologies Used

The project was built using the following technologies:

- Flutter: A cross-platform mobile development framework 
- Flutter sdk: 3.19.3
- Dart: The programming language used for building Flutter applications
- SQLite: A lightweight, serverless, and self-contained SQL database engine used for storing task data
- Provider: A state management library for Flutter
- Flutter easy_localization: A plugin for internationalization and localization but i didn't used it in whole app ,i want to show how we implement it with a simple way

5. the server host is blocked in some countries, so make sure of your country and turn on a vpn. 


## Future Improvements

Here are some potential improvements that could be made to the project:
1. **filter tasks depends on its status (completed or not )
2. **improve ui 
3. **implement responsive ui from flutter plugins like (screen utils, sizer, responsive sizer
4. **Integration with Cloud Services**: Integrate the app with cloud-based task management services, such as Google Tasks or Microsoft To-Do, to allow users to sync their tasks across devices.
5. **Collaborative Task Management**: Add the ability for users to share tasks with others and collaborate on them.
6. **Recurring Tasks**: Improve the recurring task feature to allow more complex recurrence patterns, such as every other week or every third Tuesday of the month.
